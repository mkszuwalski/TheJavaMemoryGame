Play or play not. There is no try. There is no catch.

I first encountered a personal computer in 1986, when my dad bought a ZX Spectrum+ microcomputer during a scientific conference behind the Iron Curtain.
The black plastic box at first tempted me with games. 
When I got the first book on programming this hardware in BASIC language coding became my passion. 
My first graphic demos, simple text and Pong or Arkanoid type games were created back then. 
Since then coding has been present in my life. 
I like how similar it is to mathematics and logic - it is governed by certain laws and rules, which, if you know them well, allow you to create your programming solutions.
